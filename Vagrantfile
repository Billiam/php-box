  # All Vagrant configuration is done here. The most common configuration
  # options are documented and commented below. For a complete reference,
  # please see the online documentation at vagrantup.com.

  # Every Vagrant virtual environment requires a box to build off of.

  config.vm.hostname = "php.dev"

  # The url from where the 'config.vm.box' box will be fetched if it
  # doesn't already exist on the user's system.

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.56.21"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network :public_network

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
    
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--natdnsproxy1", "off"]
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--natdnshostresolver1", "off"]
  #   # Don't boot with headless mode
  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "2048"]
  end

  # This shell provisioner installs librarian-puppet and runs it to install
  # puppet modules. After that it just runs puppet
  config.vm.provision :shell, :path => "shell/bootstrap.sh"

  config.vm.provision :puppet do |puppet|
    puppet.manifests_path = "puppet/manifests"
    puppet.manifest_file  = "main.pp"

    puppet.options = "--hiera_config /vagrant/hiera.yaml"
